## Instruction
You are given date reasoning question, and you are asked to design python functions to help solve a question.
You can use datetime, etc. or other packages if necessary.
You should specify the parameters and returns of your tool and how to use your tool with explanation.
You must write a function wrapped in ``python `` code blocks. No extra texts are allowed.
If necessary, you may also *leverage* or *mimic* the functions below to help solve the problem. Pay attention to all details such as signs and order of operation within the tools.
You should review both the docstring and internal implementation of the tool functions to correctly pass parameters, rather than solely relying on the docstring.

## Basic Tools
```python
from datetime import date
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
def format_date(input_date, format_string):
    """
    Formats the date according to the specified format.
    :param input_date: The date object to format.
    :param format_string: The format in which to print the date.
    :return: The formatted date string.
    """
    return input_date.strftime(format_string)
```

## Tools Creation Examples

### Question

In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Tools

```python
from datetime import date
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import calendar

def get_date_one_week_from_us_thanksgiving(year):
    """
    Calculate the date one week from Thanksgiving in a given year.
    Thanksgiving in the US is on the fourth Thursday of November.
    Args:
        year (int): The year for which to calculate Thanksgiving's date.
    Returns:
        str: The date one week from Thanksgiving in MM/DD/YYYY format.
    """
    # 1. Find the first Thursday of November
    date_1st_thu = date(year, 11, 1)
    while date_1st_thu.weekday() != calendar.THURSDAY:
        date_1st_thu += relativedelta(days=1)
    # 2. Calculate the fourth Thursday
    days_from_1st_to_4th_thu = (4 - 1) * 7
    date_thanksgiving = date_1st_thu + relativedelta(days=days_from_1st_to_4th_thu)
    # 3. Add one week
    date_one_week_from_thanksgiving = date_thanksgiving + relativedelta(weeks=1)
    # 4. Return in MM/DD/YYYY format
    return date_one_week_from_thanksgiving.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
```

### Question

Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Today could not be 12/32/1929 because December has only 31 days. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Tools
```python
def calculate_tomorrow_from_yesterday(yesterday):
    """
    Calculate the date tomorrow based on yesterday's date.

    Args:
        yesterday (str): Yesterday's date in MM/DD/YYYY format.

    Returns:
        str: Tomorrow's date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
    """
    from datetime import datetime
    from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
    # Parse yesterday's date
    date_yesterday = datetime.strptime(yesterday, "%m/%d/%Y").date()
    # Calculate today's date
    date_today = date_yesterday + relativedelta(days=1)
    # Calculate tomorrow's date
    date_tomorrow = date_today + relativedelta(days=1)
    return date_tomorrow.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
```

### Question

The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Tools
```python
def calculate_one_week_from_today(day_before_yesterday):
    """
    Calculate the date one week from today, given the day before yesterday's date.

    Args:
        day_before_yesterday (str): The day before yesterday's date in MM/DD/YYYY format.

    Returns:
        str: The date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.
    """
    from datetime import datetime
    from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
    # Parse the day before yesterday's date
    date_day_before_yesterday = datetime.strptime(day_before_yesterday, "%m/%d/%Y").date()
    # Calculate today's date
    date_today = date_day_before_yesterday + relativedelta(days=2)
    # Calculate the date one week from today
    date_one_week_from_today = date_today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
    return date_one_week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
```


### Question

Today's meeting is rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, 10/16/1924. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Tools
```python
def calculate_today_from_rescheduled_meeting(meeting_date):
    """
    Calculate today's date based on a meeting rescheduled to tomorrow.

    Args:
        meeting_date (str): The rescheduled meeting date in MM/DD/YYYY format.

    Returns:
        str: Today's date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
    """
    from datetime import datetime
    from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
    # Parse the meeting date
    date_meeting = datetime.strptime(meeting_date, "%m/%d/%Y").date()
    # Calculate today's date
    date_today = date_meeting - relativedelta(days=1)
    return date_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
```
