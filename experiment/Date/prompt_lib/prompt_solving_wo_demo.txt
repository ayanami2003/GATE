Your task is to solve simple word problems by creating Python programs.

You may also leverage the following helper functions, but must avoid fabricating and calling undefined function names, such as `calculate_date_by_years`.

Examples:
Query: In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Program:
```python
# import relevant packages
from datetime import date, time, datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import calendar
# 1. What is the date of the first Thursday of November? (independent, support: [])
date_1st_thu = date(2001,11,1)
while date_1st_thu.weekday() != calendar.THURSDAY:
    date_1st_thu += relativedelta(days=1)
# 2. How many days are there in a week? (independent, support: ["External knowledge: There are 7 days in a week."])
n_days_of_a_week = 7
# 3. What is the date today? (depends on 1 and 2, support: ["Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001", "Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November"])
days_from_1st_to_4th_thu = (4-1) * n_days_of_a_week
date_today = date_1st_thu + relativedelta(days=days_from_1st_to_4th_thu)
# 4. What is the date one week from today? (depends on 3, support: [])
date_1week_from_today = date_today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
# 5. Final Answer: What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY? (depends on 4, support: [])
answer = date_1week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
# print the answer
print(answer)
```

Query: Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Today could not be 12/32/1929 because December has only 31 days. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?
Program:

date_today = date_yesterday + relativedelta(days=1)
# 3. What is the date tomorrow? (depends on 2, support: [])
date_tomorrow = date_today + relativedelta(days=1)
# 4. Final Answer: What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY? (depends on 3, support: [])

Query: The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Program:
```python

# 3. What is the date one week from today? (depends on 2, support: [])

# 4. Final Answer: What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY? (depends on 3, support: [])
answer = date_1week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
# print the answer
print(answer)

Query: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?
Program:

# 4. What is the date tomorrow? (depends on 3, support: [])

# 5. Final Answer: What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY? (depends on 4, support: [])
answer = date_tomorrow.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
# print the answer
print(answer)
#DONE
```


Query: Today's meeting is rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, 10/16/1924. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Program: 
```python
# import relevant packages
from datetime import date, time, datetime

answer = date_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
# print the answer
print(answer)
#DONE
```

Query: Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?
Program: 
```python
# import relevant packages
from datetime import date 
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
# 1. What is the given date for the problem? (independent, support: ["Today is the second day of the third month of 1966"])
year = 1966 
month = 3
day = 2
# 2. What is the date today? (depends on 1, support: ["Today is the second day of the third month of 1966"])

# 3. What is the date yesterday? (depends on 2, support: [])
date_yesterday = date_today + relativedelta(days=-1)
# 4. Final Answer: What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY? (depends on 3, support: [])
