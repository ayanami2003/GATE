### Instruction
Your original codes have met some errors when executing, please rectify your codes.
You should generate the whole one new piece of code, instead of generating a snippet.
Wrap your code in ```python\n ... \n``` to make it a one whole code block.
Pay attention to the conditions in question before modifying.
Your goal is answer the question correctly instead of just execute the code successfully.
If necessary, you can also generate a whole new tool. Change your way of thinking to solve the problem.

## Examples
### Question
What is the date one week from today if today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001 (fourth Thursday of November)?
### Original Codes
```python
from datetime import date
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import calendar
def calculate_date_one_week_from_thanksgiving(year):
    """
    Calculates the date one week from Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday of November) in a given year.
    """
    date_1st_thu = date(year, 11, 1)
    while date_1st_thu.weekday() != calendar.THURSDAY:
        date_1st_thu += relativedelta(days=1)
    days_from_1st_to_4th_thu = (4 - 1) * 7
    thanksgiving_date = date_1st_thu + relativedelta(days=days_from_1st_to_4th_thu)
    date_one_week_from_today = thanksgiving_date + relativedelta(weeks=1)
    return date_one_week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
print("Final Answer:", calculate_date_one_week_from_thanksgiving(2001))
```
### Error Information
Traceback (most recent call last):
File “test_code.py”, line 12, in 
print(“Final Answer:”, calculate_date_one_week_from_thanksgiving(2001))
File “test_code.py”, line 6, in calculate_date_one_week_from_thanksgiving
date_1st_thu += relativedelta(days=1)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: ‘datetime.date’ and ‘relativedelta.relativedelta’
### Rectified Code
The error occurs because datetime.date objects do not support direct addition of relativedelta objects. To fix this, I should ensure that the addition uses a new assignment instead of an in-place operation like +=.
```python
from datetime import date
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import calendar
def calculate_date_one_week_from_thanksgiving(year):
    """
    Calculates the date one week from Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday of November) in a given year.
    """
    date_1st_thu = date(year, 11, 1)
    while date_1st_thu.weekday() != calendar.THURSDAY:
        date_1st_thu = date_1st_thu + relativedelta(days=1)
    days_from_1st_to_4th_thu = (4 - 1) * 7
    thanksgiving_date = date_1st_thu + relativedelta(days=days_from_1st_to_4th_thu)
    date_one_week_from_today = thanksgiving_date + relativedelta(weeks=1)
    return date_one_week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
print("Final Answer:", calculate_date_one_week_from_thanksgiving(2001))
```


### Question
The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. What is the date one week from today?
### Original Codes
```python
from datetime import date
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

def calculate_date_one_week_from_given_date(day_before_yesterday_str):
    """
    Calculate the date one week from today, given the day before yesterday's date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
    """
    day_before_yesterday = date.strptime(day_before_yesterday_str, "%m/%d/%Y").date()
    today = day_before_yesterday + relativedelta(days=2)
    one_week_from_today = today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
    return one_week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")

print("Final Answer:", calculate_date_one_week_from_given_date("11/23/1933"))
```
### Error Information
Traceback (most recent call last):
File “test_code.py”, line 12, in 
print(“Final Answer:”, calculate_date_one_week_from_given_date(“11/23/1933”))
File “test_code.py”, line 6, in calculate_date_one_week_from_given_date
day_before_yesterday = date.strptime(day_before_yesterday_str, “%m/%d/%Y”).date()
AttributeError: type object ‘date’ has no attribute ‘strptime’
### Rectified Code
The date class from datetime does not have a strptime method. Instead, the datetime class should be used for parsing dates.
```python
from datetime import datetime, date
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
def calculate_date_one_week_from_given_date(day_before_yesterday_str):
    """
    Calculate the date one week from today, given the day before yesterday's date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
    """
    day_before_yesterday = datetime.strptime(day_before_yesterday_str, "%m/%d/%Y").date()
    today = day_before_yesterday + relativedelta(days=2)
    one_week_from_today = today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
    return one_week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
print("Final Answer:", calculate_date_one_week_from_given_date("11/23/1933"))
```
