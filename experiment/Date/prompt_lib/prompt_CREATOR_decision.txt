    date_1st_thu = date(year, 11, 1)
    while date_1st_thu.weekday() != calendar.THURSDAY:
        date_1st_thu += relativedelta(days=1)
    # 2. Calculate the fourth Thursday
    days_from_1st_to_4th_thu = (4 - 1) * 7
    date_thanksgiving = date_1st_thu + relativedelta(days=days_from_1st_to_4th_thu)
    # 3. Add one week
    date_one_week_from_thanksgiving = date_thanksgiving + relativedelta(weeks=1)
    # 4. Return in MM/DD/YYYY format
