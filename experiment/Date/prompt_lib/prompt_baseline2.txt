Your task is to solve simple word problems by creating Python programs. 
Please show your thoughts in python codes.
Please wrap your codes in ```python ... ``` to make it one whole code block.

## Examples

### Question

In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Solution Code
```python
from datetime import date, time, datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import calendar
date_1st_thu = date(2001,11,1)
while date_1st_thu.weekday() != calendar.THURSDAY:
    date_1st_thu += relativedelta(days=1)
n_days_of_a_week = 7
days_from_1st_to_4th_thu = (4-1) * n_days_of_a_week
date_today = date_1st_thu + relativedelta(days=days_from_1st_to_4th_thu)
date_1week_from_today = date_today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
answer = date_1week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
# print the answer
print(answer)
```

### Question

Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Today could not be 12/32/1929 because December has only 31 days. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Solution Code
```python
from datetime import date, time, datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
date_yesterday = date(1929,12,31)
date_today = date_yesterday + relativedelta(days=1)
date_tomorrow = date_today + relativedelta(days=1)
answer = date_tomorrow.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
# print the answer
print(answer)
```

### Question

The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Solution Code
```python
from datetime import date, time, datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
date_day_before_yesterday = date(1933,11,23)
date_today = date_day_before_yesterday + relativedelta(days=2)
date_1week_from_today = date_today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
answer = date_1week_from_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
print(answer)
```

### Question

Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Solution Code
```python
from datetime import date, time, datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import calendar
is_leap_2001 = calendar.isleap(2001)
if is_leap_2001:
    date_jane_birth = date(2001,2,29)
else:
    date_jane_birth = date(2001,2,28)
date_today = date_jane_birth + relativedelta(years=16)
date_tomorrow = date_today + relativedelta(days=1)
answer = date_tomorrow.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
# print the answer
print(answer)
```


### Question

Today's meeting is rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, 10/16/1924. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Solution Code
```python
from datetime import date, time, datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
date_meeting = date(1924,10,16)
date_today = date_meeting - relativedelta(days=1)
answer = date_today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
# print the answer
print(answer)
```

### Question

Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?

### Solution Code
```python
from datetime import date
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
# The given date for the problem
year = 1966
month = 3
day = 2
# Set the given date
date_today = date(year, month, day)
# Calculate yesterday's date
date_yesterday = date_today + relativedelta(days=-1)
# Format the result
answer = date_yesterday.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
print(answer)
```
