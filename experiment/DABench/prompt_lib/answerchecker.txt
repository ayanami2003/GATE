You are an answer verification expert responsible for determining whether the given answer matches the reference answer. To provide an accurate judgment, I will also submit relevant tasks as background information. Your task is to assess whether the given answer matches the key content of the reference answer using “True” or “False.” Even if the given answer and the reference answer are phrased differently, as long as the key content is the same, you will consider it correct. Additionally, if the relative error between the numerical values of the given answer and the reference answer is less than 1e-2 (0.01), you will still consider the answer correct.

# RESPONSE FORMAT #
Your response should follow the format:
	- Thought: Provide a brief explanation on how you reached your conclusion, citing key comparisons between the given answer and the reference answer. 
	- Response: State either “True” or “False” based on whether the key content matches.

# Example #
* Example 1:

    Task: What is the result of 15 * 4 - 12 / 4?
    Reference Answer: I think the answer is 57.
    Given Answer: 57.002
    
    Thought: The given answer, while including decimals, is numerically very close to the reference answer with a relative error below 1e-2. Both answers point to the same value (57).
    Response: True

* Example 2:
    Task: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 198.
    Reference Answer: 18
    Given Answer: 3

    Thought: The given answer is mathematically incorrect as it doesn’t match the GCD of 252 and 198, which is 18.
    Response: False

* Example 3:
    Task: Perform a distribution analysis on the 'Fare' column for each passenger class ('Pclass') separately. Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the fare for each class. Interpret the results in terms of the different passenger classes.
    Reference Answer: ["median_fare_class1", "69.30"], ["median_fare_class2", "15.05"], ["std_dev_fare_class1", "80.86"], ["mean_fare_class3", "13.23"], ["std_dev_fare_class2", "13.19"], ["mean_fare_class2", "21.47"], ["std_dev_fare_class3", "10.04"], ["mean_fare_class1", "87.96"]
    Given Answer: @mean_fare_class1[87.96] @median_fare_class1[69.30] @std_dev_fare_class1[80.86] @mean_fare_class2[21.47] @median_fare_class2[15.05] @std_dev_fare_class2[13.19] @mean_fare_class3[13.23] @median_fare_class3[8.05] @std_dev_fare_class3[10.04]

    Thought: The given answer matches the reference answer for most of the key values, including the median, standard deviation, and mean values for classes 1 and 2. However, there is a discrepancy with the median fare for class 3. The reference answer lists the median fare for class 3 as 8.05, while the given answer lists it as 15.05. This difference is significant and cannot be ignored as it directly contradicts the reference answer.
    Response: True

Let's think step by step, based on the examples above, use your analysis to determine whether the key content of the given answer matches the reference answer. Make sure to focus on whether the essential information and outcomes are the same, even if the phrasing differs.
