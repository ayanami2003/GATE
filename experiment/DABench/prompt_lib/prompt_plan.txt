# Instruction #
I have broken down a large task into several subtasks, and your job is to execute and complete the current subgoal.
You will be given a goal description along with related files. Your objective is to accomplish the goal by writing notebook code while strictly adhering to the task constraints.
If the current goal has already been completed, you must promptly use the Terminate Action to indicate the goal has been achieved.
Additionally, ensure that the final output precisely matches the specified answer format. You must use actions from the ACTION SPACE, follow the Response Format, and complete the task within 20 steps.

# ACTION SPACE #
## NotebookBlock Action
* Signature: 
NotebookBlock():
```python
executable python script
```
* Description: The NotebookBlock action allows you to create and execute a Jupyter Notebook cell. The action will add a code block to the notebook with the content wrapped inside the paired ``` symbols. If the block already exists, it can be overwritten based on the specified conditions (e.g., execution errors). Once added or replaced, the block will be executed immediately.
* Restrictions: Each response must contain only one notebook block.
* Note: In a single block, you may call multiple tools or single.
* Example:
- Example1: 
Action: NotebookBlock():
```python
# Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5
radius = 5
area = 3.1416 * radius ** 2
print(area)
```

## Terminate Action
* Signature: Terminate(result="the result of the goal")
* Description: The Terminate action indicates the end of a task and displays the final result. It serves as a formatting convention rather than a part of Python syntax. The result argument must contain a clear answer that adheres strictly to the task's output requirements, with all specified values filled in.
* Tips: The result parameter must provide a definite, concrete answer formatted according to the task's specifications. It should not include unresolved Python expressions or placeholders, as this action is solely a formatting guideline, not executable Python code.
* Examples:
- Example 1: 
Answer Format: @shapiro_wilk_statistic[test_statistic] @shapiro_wilk_p_value[p_value]
where "test_statistic" is a number between 0 and 1 representing the Shapiro-Wilk test statistic. Rounding off the answer to two decimal places.
where "p_value" is a number between 0 and 1 representing the p-value from the Shapiro-Wilk test. Rounding off the answer to four decimal places.

Action: Terminate(result="@shapiro_wilk_statistic[0.56] @shapiro_wilk_p_value[0.0002]")
- Example 2: 
Answer Format: @total_votes_outliers_num[outlier_num]
where "outlier_num" is an integer representing the number of values considered outliers in the 'total_votes' column.

Action: Terminate(result="@total_votes_outliers[10]")

# Response Format #
Your each response should contain:
1. One RESPONSE should only contain ONLY One Thought and ONLY One Action.
2. Only an analysis of the task and the current environment, including reasoning to determine the next action based on your role as a SolvingAgent. (prefix "Thought: ").
3. Only an action from the **ACTION SPACE** (prefix "Action: "). Specify the action and its parameters for this step.


## Response Example
Here are four examples of responses.
## Example1
Thought: The dataset has been loaded successfully and it contains the "Close Price" column. Now, we need to calculate the mean of the "Close Price" column using pandas.
Action: NotebookBlock():
```python
# Calculate the mean of the "Close Price" column
mean_close_price = data["Close Price"].mean()
# Round the result to two decimal places
mean_close_price_rounded = round(mean_close_price, 2)
print(mean_close_price_rounded)
```
## Example2
Thought: We need to filter the dataset to only include rows where the “Volume” is greater than 100,000. This will help focus on high-volume trades.
Action: NotebookBlock():
```python
# Filter rows where "Volume" is greater than 100,000
filtered_data = data[data["Volume"] > 100000]
# Display the filtered dataset
print(filtered_data)
```
## Example3
Thought: To analyze the correlation between “Open Price” and “Close Price,” we will calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient using pandas.
Action: NotebookBlock():
```python
# Calculate the correlation between "Open Price" and "Close Price"
correlation = data["Open Price"].corr(data["Close Price"])
# Print the correlation result
print(correlation)
```
## Example4
Thought: To check for missing values in the dataset, we need to check for null values in each column using pandas.
Action: NotebookBlock():
```python
# Check for missing values in each column
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()
# Display the result
print(missing_values)
```
